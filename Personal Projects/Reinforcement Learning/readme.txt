## RL README

### This directory contains reinforcement learning projects I have completed.  

### Currently contains a single tic_tac_toe agent that learns the game by playing itself and then playing against a user on a board displayed in a bash terminal.  To play, just execute the python file in a terminal and the board will display.

#### This readme will update if new projects are added
